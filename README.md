# Jack's Prioritized To-Do List
A simple to-do list/scrum board app implemented in HTML/JS/CSS.
## Why make ANOTHER to-do list app?
As the Sustainability Office hires more folks that are able to contribute to software projects, a new solution will be needed to manage their workload. This app aims to satisfy that need by organizing tasks into user stories on a scrum board. Tasks are listed for the programmers based on priority, and the date in which the respective task was assigned. The app is accessible at: [http://jackstodolist.tk](http://jackstodolist.tk) and [http://sosoftware.tk](http://sosoftware.tk).
## How can I deploy my own to-do list app?
It's easy! Just clone this repo, then edit the "config.json" file in the root directory of this repository. That's it!
## How to Use
This app allows for our office to quickly assign tasks to programmers. To assign a task, first select a project at the top of the page. Next, select a user which will be assigned to this task. Finally, enter the desired title and description of the task and click the "Add Task" button. Automagically, a pull request will be created on the task's respective repository and the selected programmer will be assigned to that task.
## Planned Features:
	 - Assigned "Due Dates" for tasks.
	 - Mobile Compatibility
	 - Add software development statistics such as features completed per week, etc.
	 - GitHub Repo Integration - Users will be able to create & assign pull requests on all of the Sustainability Office repos. This will allow for easy feature implementation and version management.
	 - Multiple Users - Allow for multiple programmers in the SO to manage pull requests collaboratively.
	 - Easy Deployment - Add functionality for easy deployment so others can host their own to-do lists!
