# Jack's Prioritized To-Do List
A simple to-do list app implemented in HTML/JS/CSS. This repo was originally cloned from [https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo](https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo).
## Why make ANOTHER todo list app?
This app is meant to be an easy way for others to assign me tasks in the office. It will be hosted using GitHub Pages, and it will be accessible at: [http://jackstodolist.tk](http://jackstodolist.tk) and [http://sosoftware.tk](http://sosoftware.tk).
## How can I deploy my own todo list app?
Stay tuned! Star this repo and/or follow my profile for updates.
## Planned Features:
	 - GitHub Repo Integration - Users will be able to create & assign me to pull requests on all of the Sustainability Office repos I contribute to. This will allow for easy feature implementation and version management.
	 - Multiple Users - Allow for multiple programmers in the SO to manage pull requests collaboratively.
	 - Easy Deployment - Add functionality for easy deployment so others can host their own to-do lists!
